Forget The Bossa Nova, Brazil Is Now The Country Of Electronic Music

When you think of Brazil, you may think of it as the South American birthplace of music genres like the samba or bossa nova. But for the past few years, Brazil has become one of the meccas of electronic music too.&nbsp; A title that it now shares with the likes of Germany, France and the United States, where e-music is not only a controversial topic (is it a form of art or not&#63;) but also big business.

According to a study commissioned by the organizers of the Rio Music Conference, the largest gathering of e-music and entertainment in the Southern Hemisphere, which is taking place this month in Rio de Janeiro, ticket vendors collected $515 million for electronic music events in 2011, up 56.64% from the previous year. The study also shows that the e-music segment in Brazil reached an audience of 19.5 million people last year, who spent another $626 million on accommodation, food, transportation and other items. Sponsoring investments, the cream of the crop for these events, was also up to $270 million, an increase of 60% compared to 2010.

The growing e-music industry in the country of Carnival is also good news for international DJs such as David Guetta, Ferry Corstern, Sven Vath, Erick Morillo, Fatboy Slim, Bob Sinclair, Armin van Buuren, The Prodigy, Kaskade and Nalaya, all of whom have performed&nbsp; there recently, commanding fees of up to $100,000 per gig. In total, the collective sum paid to DJs who performed in Brazil in 2011 was $57.2 million, 79.9% more than 2010.

But why has Brazil become such a hotspot for e-music professionals&#63; In spite of its population&rsquo;s predilection for late-night dance parties, the country&rsquo;s sizzling economy has a lot to do with it. Most of the bash-goers who attend e-music events in Brazil are twenty or thirty-something, well-heeled, middle-class citizens who don&rsquo;t mind paying a fairly high price for fancy fare (tickets for a David Guetta concert held in Sao Paulo last month were sold for up to $600 per person). Add to this the fact that nearly 40 million people have joined Brazil&rsquo;s middle class since 2003, and you have a wealth of assets.

It&rsquo;s also worth noticing that Brazil&rsquo;s nightclubs are among the top rated worldwide. Ten years after its opening, Sao Paulo&rsquo;s Disco club is still one of the favorite destinations for the city&rsquo;s sailing, polo-playing smart set, also attracting international celebrities such as supermodels Gisele Bundchen and Naomi Campbell. The club&rsquo;s futuristic interior was designed by Isay Weinfeld, one of Sao Paulo&rsquo;s most sought-after architects, and it includes a 20 sq-meter panel by the Campana brothers.

Those who favor the slightly grimier, more underground end of the clubbing spectrum are habitu&eacute;s of the D-Edge club, also located in Sao Paulo. With LED panels synced to the beats, Daft Punk decor and doors that stay open until noon, D-Edge &mdash; which was opened in 2003 &mdash; became the ultimate clubbing address for the city&rsquo;s discerning e-music aficionados.

But few places in Brazil have experienced such a dynamic growth in the e-music business as the city of Balneario Camboriu, a busy summer resort that is fast becoming Brazil&rsquo;s answer to Miami. Located in he biggest tourist region in the south of the country, Balneario Camboriu hosts more than one million Brazilian and foreign tourists every year, a lot of them visiting just for enjoying its nightlife. The city, which is located in the state of Santa Catarina, is the home of the two best clubs in Brazil, according to the bible of electronic music, Britain&rsquo;s DJ Magazine.

The Green Valley club, which is listed by the publication as the third best club in the world, occupies a gigantic tarpaulin-covered arena at the foot of a giant valley dense with lush rainforest and surrounded by numerous bars on wooden platforms. Handpicking only the most internationally recognized DJ talent, Green Valley can pull in up to $1.6 million per night. The other club is Warung, which is actually located in the division between Balneario Camboriu and its neighboring city of Itajai. Filled with to the brim with VIP areas, Warung consistently delivers something more refined &mdash; hosting residencies from the world&rsquo;s biggest underground club brands.

And as the well-known capital of e-music in Brazil, Balneario Camboriu is just about to get an upgrade: Ibiza&rsquo;s Space club partnered up with a group of Brazilian nightlife developers in a new $3.5 million venue set to be inaugurated next October in the city, in an area of over 1.7 million sq-feet, while the nightclub franchise Pacha Group, which is also based in the Spanish island, is already considering the possibility of investing there as well.

Electronic music has been taking over the hearts and minds of youths all over the world for some time now. Originating over 30 years ago in urban Chicago and Detroit, the concept was designed to reassemble mundane disco tracks and give them greater appeal to those tired of listening to music about heartbreak, and looking to feel liberated as an individual.

In Brazil &mdash; as the numbers prove &mdash; the party&rsquo;s just begun.
